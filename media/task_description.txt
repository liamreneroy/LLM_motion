On a bright sunny day, you find yourself in a strawberry field, tasked with picking ripe strawberries. 
It's quite hot out, and you hope to complete this task efficiently so you can sit in the shade and enjoy 
the fruits of your labour. 

Your companion for this task is a robot dog named Calcifer. Calcifer is a silent robot who is only able 
to communicate using its body language. Calcifer is autonomous, meaning that he can venture off to search 
for and identify ripe strawberries. Though unable to physically pick them, he can signal to you when he's 
found ripe fruit ready to be picked.

Calcifers purpose is to boost your efficiency in the strawberry-picking task by providing 
valuable guidance and alerts.
