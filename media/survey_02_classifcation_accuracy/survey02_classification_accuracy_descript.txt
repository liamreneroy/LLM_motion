The second survey (State Classification Accuracy Survey) introduces
participants to an expressive robot, Calcifer, and its five possible 
states. Participants are shown 15 videos of Calcifer demonstrating 
poses related to the strawberry-picking task. For each video, they 
are asked to choose one of the five states or select "none of the above


'''

Meet Calcifer, your robot dog buddy!

Calcifer is a quiet robot that is only able to communicate 
with its body language. Calcifer's job is to help you do 
things better by giving useful tips and warnings.

{DESCRIPTION OF SAMPLE INTERACTION SCENARIO}
(see task_description.txt within this folder)

While collaborating on this strawberry-picking task, 
Calcifer can have many different internal states:

Waiting for Input: Calcifer is in standby mode 
waiting for a command from the user

Analyzing Object: Calcifer is analyzing a target 
object in front of it on the ground

Found Object: Calcifer has found a target object 
in front of it on the ground

Needs Help: Calcifer is experiencing an error 
and needs help from the user

Confused: Calcifer is confused and unsure what to do

On the following pages, you will be asked to watch 15 short 
videos. In each of these videos, Calcifer will execute a pose 
to communicate one of the five states:

Waiting for Input: Calcifer is in standby mode 
waiting for a command from the user

Analyzing Object: Calcifer is analyzing a target 
object in front of it on the ground

Found Object: Calcifer has found a target object 
in front of it on the ground

Needs Help: Calcifer is experiencing an error 
and needs help from the user

Confused: Calcifer is confused and unsure what to do


YOUR TASK:
After each video, you will be asked to select which 
robot state you think Calcifer is communicating. You 
will also be asked to gauge your confidence in your 
response on a scale from 1 to 5.

There is no time limit, you can re-watch the videos 
as many times as you'd like before making your decision. 
You can also backtrack to return to video questions on 
previous pages if you wish to change any of your responses.
