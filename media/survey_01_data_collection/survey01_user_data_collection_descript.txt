The first survey (User Data Collection Survey) guides participants 
through a workflow that introduces the concept of expressive robots 
and their functional states. It explains the example strawberry-picking 
task and asks participants to list between 4 and 10 possible 
functional robot states.

Meet Calcifer, your robot dog buddy!

Calcifer is a quiet robot that is only able to communicate 
with its body language. Calcifer's job is to help you do 
things better by giving useful tips and warnings.

Calcifer has many different task-dependant states. 
This means that Calcifer's states are related to the 
task you're working on together.

Let's say you're following Calcifer towards a goal. 
In this scenario, Calcifer's states might be:

Going towards the goal.
Feeling a bit lost...
Yay, we reached the goal!

Calcifer needs to let you know what state its in. 
Calcifer uses it's body language and motion to express its state.

A parameter is an aspect of the robot that we can adjust.

Calcifer can modify eight (8) different motion parameters to 
produce different poses and gestures. Five of these parameters 
relate to Calcifer's body position, and three relate to the motion 
Calcifer executes to reach a given pose.

{DESCRIPTION OF SAMPLE INTERACTION SCENARIO}
(see task_description.txt within this folder)

Imagine you are in the scenario described above...

List up to ten of Calcifer's possible states, along with a short 
description for each. You must list a minimum of at least 4 states. 

Example responses:
"Progressing - Calcifer is searching for strawberries"
"Confused - Calcifer is unsure where to go or what to do"
"Found a fruit - Calcifer found a strawberry"

State 01: [input_text_box]
State 02: [input_text_box]
State 03: [input_text_box]
...
State 10: [input_text_box]

For each state listed, participants were asked to select 
relevant motion parameters and associated values, based on the 
provided list of 8 parameters shown in the video.
